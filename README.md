# DAWN-11-15
This was the final project for my first semester Java course at KIT. This is a slightly updated version of the original [DAWN 11/15](https://www.althofer.de/dawn-11-15.html) game by Professor Ingo Alth√∂fer.

Some notes:
* Terminal.printLine(message) is just System.out.println(message)
* Terminal.readLine takes in input from the user as a String
* Terminal.printError(message) is just System.out.println("Error, " + message)

They are methods from the Terminal class that KIT provides to us. It was not uploaded here due to copyright.
